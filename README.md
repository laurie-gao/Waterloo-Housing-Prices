Project includes webscraping, data visualization, and machine learning 

# Webscraping
- Webscraping information from [royallepage.ca](https://www.royallepage.ca/en/on/waterloo/properties/) is done with **BeautifulSoup** 
- Efforts have been made to bypass the advertisements and other non-useful information on the page  
- A total of 6 pages of listings are scraped and the data has been combined into 1 summary csv file 

# Data Visualization
- Used pandas to clean the data and used seaborn and matplotlib to graph the data
